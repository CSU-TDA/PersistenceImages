# PersistenceImages
This code accompanies the paper "Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology" by Henry Adams, Sofya Chepushtanova, Tegan Emerson, Eric Hanson, Michael Kirby, Francis Motta, Rachel Neville, Chris Peterson, Patrick Shipman, and Lori Ziegelmeier, Journal of Machine Learning Research 18 (2017), Number 8, 1-35. The code is mainly written for use with Matlab.

Three different implementations of persistence images in Python (instead of Matlab) are available at https://gitlab.com/csu-tda/PersistenceImages, at https://github.com/sauln/persim, and at https://github.com/scikit-tda/persim.
A fourth implementation in Julia is available at https://github.com/chronchi/PersistenceImage.jl.
