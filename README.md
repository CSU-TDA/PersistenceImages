# PersistenceImages
This code, which is under development, accompanies the paper "Persistence Images: A Stable Vector Representation of Persistent Homology" by Henry Adams, Sofya Chepushtanova, Tegan Emerson, Eric Hanson, Michael Kirby, Francis Motta, Rachel Neville, Chris Peterson, Patrick Shipman, and Lori Ziegelmeier, Journal of Machine Learning Research 18 (2017), Number 8, 1-35. The code is mainly written for use with Matlab. Since the code is still under development, we recommend that you email the authors of this paper before trying to use the code.

A different implementation of this code (in python instead of Matlab) is available at https://gitlab.com/csu-tda/PersistenceImages
